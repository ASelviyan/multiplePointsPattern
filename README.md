## Learning About Multiple Pointers Pattern 
#### Technology used: Javascript 

#### Problem #1: SumZero
- Write a function called sumZero which accepts sorted array of integers. the function should find the first pair where the sum is 0. Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero OR undefined if a pair does not exist 
- we know that the array that is given to us is sorted

#### Problem #2: CountUniqueValues
- Implement a function called countUniqueValues which accepts a sorted array, and counts the unique values in the array. There can be negative numbers in the array, but it will always be sorted 

#### Problem #3: Are There Duplicates 
- Implement a function called, areThereDuplicates which accepts a variable number of arguments, and checks whether there are any duplicates among the arguments passed in.  You can solve this using the frequency counter pattern OR the multiple pointers pattern.
